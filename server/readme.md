# Simple Server

Used Fastify to learn and explore something not in my skills using provided scafold code

After you get the code run `yarn` or `npm install` to pull all of the dependencies

**MAKE SURE YOU ARE IN THE SERVER DIRECTORY WHEN YOU DO THIS**

Then to run execute `yarn run server` or `npm run server`

You can then go to `localhost:9500` and do the following things:

1. http://localhost:9500/search?name=cryptotracker
2. http://localhost:9500/search?id=1
3. http://localhost:9500/ghsecure/users/geeta-kukreja/repo



### Loading API data on PageLoad

#### **IMPORTANT - you are free to integrate and steal any code from this branch into your project.  I am using the axios client library to make API calls.  In the event you get an error, you likely do not have axios installed.**

#### **To install `axios`, go to the root of your project - the directory with `package.json` in it and execute `yarn add axios` or `npm install axios --save`**
