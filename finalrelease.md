Frontend Architecture:
The frontend of the application will be developed using Vue.js, a popular JavaScript framework for building user interfaces. Vue.js provides a reactive and component-based architecture, allowing for efficient development and easy maintenance of the application. The frontend will consist of multiple components responsible for rendering different views and handling user interactions.

Communication with GitHub API:
To access the GitHub API, the application will use a GitHub access token. This token will be securely stored on the server-side and sent as an authorization header with each API request. The frontend will make RESTful API calls to retrieve repository and gist information from the GitHub API endpoints. The fetched data will be processed and displayed to the user in a meaningful way.

Backend Architecture:
The backend of the application will be implemented using Fastify, a lightweight and high-performance web framework for Node.js. Fastify allows for efficient request handling and provides various plugins for extended functionality. The backend will primarily serve as a proxy server, forwarding API requests from the frontend to the GitHub API and handling the GitHub access token securely.

Authentication and Security:
To ensure secure access to the GitHub API, the application will utilize the GitHub access token for authentication. The token will be securely stored on the server-side and never exposed to the client-side. The server will validate the token before forwarding requests to the GitHub API, ensuring only authorized requests are processed.
